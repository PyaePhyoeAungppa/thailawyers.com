            Yes, foreigners can own 100% of a company in Thailand depending on whether it is allowed by the Foreign
            Business Law. International investors may also establish branch offices or Treaty of Amity companies

            A representative office is suitable if your establishment in Thailand is not for earning income but for

            BOI (Board of Investment) promotion is favored because most BOI-promoted companies can be 100% foreign-owned
            and are allowed more work permits than non-BOI companies. This provides significant business advantages in
            Thailand.

            Many unfamiliar with Thai laws find the BOI registration process complicated. Some law firms charge high
            fees, but issues often arise involving financial, accounting, and tax matters, which lawyers alone may not
            cover. ThaiLawyers.com collaborates with experienced Thai certified accountants to ensure your business
            starts correctly.

                Looking for a consultant company to help you go through the BOI process can be a long search. For us it
                took several meetings with a few, mostly ones run by foreigners residing in Thailand because we were
                worried about the language barrier. However while their English was great, none of them felt right and
                they were all very expensive. At that point we decided to try a local Thai firm, we checked Thai Lawyers
                Ltd. of MSNA Group located in Bangkok and we never looked back.
                <br>
                The BOI application is based on a plan, this plan is more than just a simple business plan, it is a
                complex combination of cross details that cover all facets of your business, and if not filled out
                correctly and smartly, not only will the BOI will reject it, but it can also lead you to costly
                obstacles with any future expansion of your planned operation in Thailand.
                <br>
                We got our BOI approved first draft in less than 40 days, very impressive indeed.
                The staff at MSNA are professional, they all speak fluent English, it’s a modern office and is a
                pleasure to work with. If you read these lines then you got to the right place, we highly recommend
                using their service.
                <br>
              </p>

                We have engaged Thai Lawyers of MSNA Group to help facilitate our BOI application process and we are
                very satisfied with their services. They are able to deliver whatever they have promised to deliver and
                they are well versed with the BOI requirements.
                <br>
                As Thailand is a country which predominantly uses the Thai language, we are pleased with MSNA’s ability
                to be bilingual, allowing us to communicate effectively with them in English, and for all documents and
                communication with the BOI to be done in Thai. There is no language barrier which we need to overcome
                before even being able to start our BOI application process.
                <br>
                We definitely recommend MSNA’s services.

                We engaged MSNA Group to assist our company for the BOI opening of the operation interview/inspection.
                As always, it was a pleasure working with MSNA as you know you can rely on their professionalism,
                knowledge of the processes and deep experience in dealing with Thai officials to achieve the expected
                results. Before the interview MSNA handled the preparation of the necessary documents and helped to
                train our staff in dealing with the BOI officials for this occasion. A senior manager of MSNA attended
                the interview and helped to ensure the meeting run smoothly. Following the interview she followed up
                with the BOI to complete the required documentation. We have now obtained the BOI opening certificate
                and are very pleased with MSNA’ s contribution that ensured the objective was met in full in a pain-free
                way.

                Engaging Thai Lawyers Ltd to assist us in obtaining the foreign business license for our Thailand Branch
                Office is probably one of the best decisions we have made, especially after encountering impasse with a
                less effective law firm which impinged on our Thailand operation setup, and wasted much of our precious
                time.
                <br>
                Like in anywhere else, working with the local authorities is usually quite a bureaucratic process and
                tedious as well, this is exacerbated if the engaged Law firm does not know exactly how to handle it
                appropriately and effectively. Thai Lawyers Ltd. has a competent team who is responsive and thorough,
                this makes them very effective in handling the case within a short time frame. And you can have a peace
                of mind leaving the important task to them.
                <br>
                I would highly recommend Thai Lawyers Ltd. to anyone who wishes to engage a local law firm to work on
                their new establishment with the local authorities in Thailand. They certainly know and understand the
                local business culture well and are able to get things done effectively and timely.
